# Contribution Guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

- Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you have had a discussion with the project admins.
    - If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and make sure that the admins are okay with your approach
    - If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and discuss

    Please proceed with a Pull Request only after the project admins or owners are okay with your approach. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hard work) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.
