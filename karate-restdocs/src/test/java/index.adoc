Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with Karate.

This is a demo showing how web services can be documented using
`Spring Rest Docs` and `Karate`. Whenever a request is made to any
endpoint `Karate` converts its `request` and `response` objects and
passes it on to `Rest Docs` which uses them to create snippets.


Three snippets are produced. One showing how to make a request using cURL:

include::../../../target/generated-snippets/sample/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request:

include::../../../target/generated-snippets/sample/http-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:

include::../../../target/generated-snippets/sample/http-response.adoc[]
